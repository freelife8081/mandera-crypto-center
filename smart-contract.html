        <h1>Smart Contracts</h1>
        <p>
            Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. They are designed to automatically enforce and execute the terms of a contract when predetermined conditions are met. This innovation enables trustless transactions and reduces the need for intermediaries.
        </p>

        <h2>How Smart Contracts Work</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Contract Creation:</strong> A developer writes a smart contract using a programming language such as Solidity (for Ethereum). The contract contains specific rules and conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Deployment:</strong> The smart contract is deployed on a blockchain platform. Once deployed, it resides on the blockchain and is assigned a unique address.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Execution:</strong> When the conditions of the contract are triggered (for example, receiving a certain amount of cryptocurrency), the smart contract executes the specified actions automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Verification:</strong> The results of the smart contract execution are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and tamper-proof record of the transaction.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Benefits of Smart Contracts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Automation:</strong> Smart contracts eliminate the need for manual processing, reducing the time and cost associated with contract execution.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Security:</strong> Smart contracts use cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of contract terms and execution.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Trust and Transparency:</strong> The execution of smart contracts is visible to all parties involved, promoting trust and accountability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reduction of Disputes:</strong> Automated execution minimizes the chances of disputes since the contract terms are clearly defined and executed without bias.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use Cases of Smart Contracts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial Services:</strong> Automating processes like loan approvals, insurance claims, and payment settlements.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> Ensuring transparency and traceability in the supply chain by automatically recording transactions at each stage.</li>
            <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Facilitating property sales and leasing through automated escrow services and ownership transfers.</li>
            <li><strong>Voting Systems:</strong> Providing secure and tamper-proof voting mechanisms to ensure fair elections.</li>
        </ul>
