        <h1>Cryptocurrency Wallets</h1>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency wallets are tools that allow users to store and manage their digital assets. Unlike traditional wallets that hold physical cash, cryptocurrency wallets store the public and private keys required to conduct transactions on the blockchain. They also enable users to send and receive cryptocurrencies.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallets</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Hot Wallets:</strong> 
                <p>Hot wallets are connected to the internet and are easy to use for daily transactions. They include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web Wallets:</strong> Accessible through web browsers, allowing users to manage their cryptocurrencies online.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile Wallets:</strong> Applications on mobile devices that provide convenient access to cryptocurrencies on the go.</li>
                    <li><strong>Desktop Wallets:</strong> Software installed on a computer that allows users to store their cryptocurrencies securely on their device.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While hot wallets are convenient, they are more vulnerable to hacking and theft.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cold Wallets:</strong>
                <p>Cold wallets are offline storage solutions that provide a higher level of security for storing cryptocurrencies. They include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hardware Wallets:</strong> Physical devices that securely store private keys offline, making them less susceptible to online attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paper Wallets:</strong> Physical documents containing printed private and public keys, which can be generated securely offline.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Cold wallets are recommended for long-term storage and holding large amounts of cryptocurrencies.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Choose a Cryptocurrency Wallet</h2>
