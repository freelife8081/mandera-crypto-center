            <h2>Definition</h2>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized and operate on technology called blockchain, which distributes the ledger across a network of computers (nodes). This reduces the risk of fraud and manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Cryptography ensures the security of transactions and controls the creation of new units. It protects the integrity and confidentiality of transactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Supply:</strong> Many cryptocurrencies have a capped supply, meaning there is a maximum number of coins that can ever be created (e.g., Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins). This creates scarcity and can contribute to value appreciation over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymity and Privacy:</strong> Transactions made with cryptocurrencies can be conducted with varying degrees of anonymity. While all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, the identities of the parties involved are often pseudonymous.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Transactions:</strong> Cryptocurrencies can be sent or received anywhere in the world, allowing for quick and low-cost cross-border transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                <li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like fiat currencies (e.g., USDT, USDC) to reduce volatility.</li>
