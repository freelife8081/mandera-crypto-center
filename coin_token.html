        <h1>Difference between Coin and Token</h1>
        <p>
            In the world of cryptocurrency, the terms "coin" and "token" are often used interchangeably, but they represent different concepts. Understanding the distinctions between them is crucial for anyone navigating the crypto space.
        </p>

        <h2>What is a Coin?</h2>
        <p>
            A coin refers to a cryptocurrency that operates independently on its own blockchain. Coins are typically used as a digital form of currency and can be used for various purposes, such as transferring value or facilitating transactions. Examples of popular coins include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).
        </p>

        <h3>Key Characteristics of Coins</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Own Blockchain:</strong> Coins have their own blockchain and protocol, which allows them to function independently.</li>
            <li><strong>Native Currency:</strong> Coins are often used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value within their ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Mining and Staking:</strong> Some coins can be mined (e.g., Bitcoin) or staked (e.g., Ethereum 2.0) to secure the network and validate transactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is a Token?</h2>
        <p>
            A token, on the other hand, is a digital asset that is built on an existing blockchain. Tokens can represent a variety of assets or utilities, including but not limited to currency, assets, or access to specific features within a platform. Tokens are created using smart contracts, and they operate on the blockchain of another coin. Ethereum is the most common blockchain for tokens, with ERC-20 being a widely used standard.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Characteristics of Tokens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Built on Existing Blockchains:</strong> Tokens do not have their own blockchain; they leverage the infrastructure of existing ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Variety of Uses:</strong> Tokens can represent a range of assets, including utility tokens (for access to services), security tokens (representing ownership in an asset), or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Tokens are created and managed through smart contracts, allowing for automated execution of agreements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Comparison: Coin vs. Token</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Feature</th>
                    <th>Coin</th>
                    <th>Token</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Blockchain</td>
                    <td>Own Blockchain</td>
                    <td>Built on Existing Blockchain</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Primary Use</td>
                    <td>Medium of Exchange</td>
                    <td>Utility, Asset, or Access</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Creation</td>
                    <td>Mining or Staking</td>
                    <td>Through Smart Contracts</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Examples</td>
                    <td>Bitcoin, Ethereum</td>
                    <td>USDT, LINK, UNI</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding the difference between coins and tokens is fundamental for anyone involved in cryptocurrency. While coins serve as a form of digital currency operating on their own blockchains, tokens are versatile digital assets that operate on existing blockchains and can represent a wide variety of uses and values. Recognizing these distinctions can help investors and users make informed decisions in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.
